    <blockquote>Large firms generally undertake their research and development (R&D) activities through networks of laboratories located in multiple countries. Scholars have sought to understand how knowledge flows between these R&D centers through examining firms’ use of information technology, shared common routines, and long-term immigration of human capital. Less is known about whether short-term migration of scientists between R&D centers located in different countries can impact firms’ intra-organizational knowledge flows and resultant invention outcomes. However, firms often leverage short-term migration of employees, thus understanding how it can impact firms’ invention outcomes is important. We theoretically argue that short-term migration of employees to R&D centers in other countries can help to lower the communication costs associated with transferring tacit knowledge between different R&D centers. In turn, this will translate into firms creating a greater quantity of inventions that draw on a broader scope of knowledge. Further, we suggest that these benefits of reduced communication costs on firms’ invention outcomes will be magnified if the two R&D centers have an intermediate level of knowledge overlap and if their primary spoken languages differ. To empirically test these arguments, we take advantage of the creation of the visa-waiver program for up to 42 countries which increased their citizens’ ease of visiting the USA. We broadly find support for our theoretical arguments in the context of the pharmaceutical industry. Further, we find that both R&D centers (host and visitor) gain from short term migration with the magnitude being greater for centers with access to more resources.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>We study how humans learn from AI, exploiting an introduction of an AI-powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to that of APG's superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players' move quality, accompanied by decreased number and magnitude of errors. The effect is pronounced in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. In addition, younger players and those in AI-exposed countries experience greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all levels learn, less skilled players derive higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI effectively within their organizations.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>This paper examines how price competition in the product market affects the intensity and breadth of innovation. I assemble a unique data set comprising all 461 collusion cases prosecuted in the United States from 1975 through 2016 and match 1,818 collusive firms to firm-level data on innovation. Empirical results from a difference-in-differences methodology show a negative relationship between price competition and innovation. When collusion suppressed price competition, colluding firms increased patent filings by 28 percent and top-quality patents by 20 percent. A significant portion of these patents are attributable to genuine innovation activities because innovation inputs—R&D investment and the number of unique patenting inventors—increased in tandem by 16 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the number of patented technology classes increased by 16 percent as firms broadened their scope of innovation by exploring new technological areas. When competition was restored by collusion breakup, the increased and broadened innovation activities reverted to their previous levels. The effects were greater for collusion that was stronger and in fast-growing industries. I further explore market profitability and financial constraints on firms as potential mechanisms driving the trade-off between price competition and innovation growth.</blockquote>

+ **Should Firms Maintain Patents Longer? A Randomized Control Trial on the Commercial Value of Patent Protection**.  
*Revise and Resubmit*. 2024. Thompson, N., Tucci, C., Kang, H. & Khairullina, A.

    <blockquote>Globally, firms spend approximately $1.7 trillion on R&D, much of which is aimed at producing patentable innovations. But using patents to cut off competitors’ access to an innovation is expensive to get and to maintain, costing an average of $1–2 million for global protection. That expense is only worthwhile if the exclusivity generated by the patent provides enough commercial value for the firm, principally through higher sales or profitability in the product market. In practice, making decisions whether to get or maintain patents is difficult because firms often can’t quantify the commercial value of a patent, even after the fact, because they never observe the performance of an equivalent innovation that is unpatented. Academics have been similarly stymied in quantifying the commercial value of patents because of (1) strong selection into which innovations are patented, (2) the difficulty in connecting patent protection to specific products, and (3) the commercial sensitivity of product-level financial data.
      This paper presents the first randomized control trial to evaluate the commercial value of maintaining patent protection. In collaboration with a large multinational company, existing patents covering products in the marketplace were either abandoned or maintained at random. We then traced the effects of patent protection on product-level commercial outcomes using confidential internal data. On the margin, products protected by patents generated 35% more revenue for the firm, primarily through higher unit sales. Maintaining these patents was highly cost effective, yielding $67 in additional benefits for each dollar spent. Insomuch as the patenting behavior of the firm in our study is representative, our results suggest that firms should be maintaining more patent protection on products.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Strategy scholars have extensively studied how incumbent firms respond to industry shocks. One under-studied factor shaping how incumbents respond relates to how effectively they reallocate their resources to take advantage of opportunities emerging from a shock. Using an adjustment cost lens, we argue that firms with more fungible and decomposable resources are better able to take advantage of any opportunities emerging from a shock. Further, we argue that firms operating in less competitive markets will respond more effectively to the shock as they face lower adjustment costs. We find support for our arguments in the context of the US domestic airline industry following the significant impact of COVID-19 on passenger volumes, with some airlines better able to navigate the shift to freight transportation than others.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>A growing body of literature finds that a healthy corporate culture is associated with superior financial performance. A separate stream of research has found that a firm’s adoption of management “best practices” is correlated with higher efficiency and productivity. To date, the cultural and management practices literatures have proceeded in parallel, with few studies considering the relationship between an organization’s processes and its culture. This paper uses data from a carefully-designed survey of 370 organizations and nearly ten thousand managers to simultaneously measure corporate culture and management practices. Our key finding is that the quality of a company’s management practices and health of its corporate culture are highly correlated. This implies that studies which measure either culture or processes in isolation are likely to overstate their impact on performance. We also provide suggestive evidence that management practices may cause changes in corporate culture, or at least that this effect is stronger than the reverse.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>A firm can exhibit many “good” cultural values, for example collaboration, integrity, or ambition. Influential theories of corporate culture claim that firms must choose which cultural values to foster because of inherent trade-offs between them. This paper tests this proposition using a new survey of managers (370 firms, averaging 27 respondents each). We find no evidence of trade-offs. To the contrary, we find that firms that score higher on one cultural value also tend to score higher on others. Our findings suggest that any inherent trade-offs are outweighed by the ability of good management practices to help a firm excel across many cultural values.</blockquote>
