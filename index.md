I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Management and Organization at the USC Marshall School of Business. My research is centered on corporate political strategy, business-governance relationships, and emerging technology in management. Specifically, I focus on the following areas:
  + The impact of government policies on firmsâ€™ innovation processes and strategic decision-making.
  + Firms' lobbying efforts to shape governmental policies in their favor.
