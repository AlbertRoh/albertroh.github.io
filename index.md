<p class="notice">My research interest broadly lies in firm strategy and business economics, with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
# The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
# I explore three different types of competition:
## Product market competition
## Competition for labor forces, and
## Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights  
and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
