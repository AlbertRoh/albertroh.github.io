My research interest broadly lies in firm strategy and business economics, with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments. I explore three different types of competition – product market competition, competition for labor forces, and competition for innovation and intellectual property rights – and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
