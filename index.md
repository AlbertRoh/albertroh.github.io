### Welcome!
<br />
I am an Assistant Professor of Management and Organization at USC Marshall School of Business. My research is centered on competitive strategy, strategic human capital, and the economics of innovation, examining how firms manage their innovation processes and outcomes within rapidly changing business landscapes. Specifically, I focus on three core areas of competition:
  + Product market competition (e.g., whether and how price-fixing cartels affect firm innovation)
  + Competition for human capital (e.g., worker mobility within and across firms and borders)
  + Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights (e.g., how worker mobility influences firms' strategic decisions regarding patenting versus secrecy).


In this context, I have empirically examined a diverse array of topics, encompassing antitrust enforcements, the US visa waiver program, non-compete agreements, short-selling regulations, and a randomized controlled trial focused on patent renewals. Through these studies, my overarching research theme is dedicated to uncovering strategies and public policies that stimulate innovation, ultimately enhancing firms' strategic positioning and performance.


In recent days, I also explore the impact of artificial intelligence on decision-making, knowledge creation, and organizational performance. The context includes an AI-powered X-ray triage solution and an AI-powered Go programs.
