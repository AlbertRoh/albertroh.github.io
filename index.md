### Welcome!
<br />
My research interest broadly lies in firm strategy and business economics, with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.
+ The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
+ I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
  1. Product market competition
  2. Competition for labor forces, and
  3. Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
