### My research interest broadly lies in firm strategy and business economics, with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.
+ The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
+ I explore three different types of competition:
  1. Product market competition
  2. Competition for labor forces, and
  3. Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights

and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
